A sensible initial value might be $Q_{cl} = 100$ Wm$^{-2}$, but it is likely to be substantially smaller in the convecting region (due to high cloud and water vapour amount) and on our planets due to the direct absorption of stellar radiation because M star's spectra are very red. $\\Delta \\theta$ is the change in potential temperature across the troposphere. Again, a sensible initial value to try is probably $\\Delta \\theta = 50$ K.\n",
